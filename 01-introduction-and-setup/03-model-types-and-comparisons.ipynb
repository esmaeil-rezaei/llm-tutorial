    "# Exploring Different Types of Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's session takes a different approach. Instead of working through code labs, we'll explore language models through hands-on experimentation with their chat interfaces. This direct interaction provides invaluable insight into how these models behave, what they excel at, and where they struggle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Three Breeds of Language Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models come in three fundamental varieties, each designed for specific tasks and use cases. Understanding these distinctions helps you choose the right tool for your application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Models: The Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "A base model represents the most fundamental form of language model. Its sole purpose is to take a sequence of information as input and predict what should come next. These models haven't been trained to follow instructions or engage in conversation—they simply complete sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "You actually use a base model regularly, though you might not realize it. The predictive text feature on your smartphone operates as a base model. When you type \"Hello there\" and the keyboard suggests the next word, it's predicting the most likely continuation of your sequence. Each time you select a word, that word joins the sequence, and the model predicts what should follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before ChatGPT emerged in 2022, earlier versions like GPT-3 functioned primarily as base models. Users needed creative workarounds to make them useful. A common technique involved structuring prompts as question-and-answer sequences: \"Q: [question]\" followed by \"A: [answer]\", repeated several times to establish a pattern. Then you'd write \"Q: [your actual question]\" and start with \"A:\" to prompt the model into answer mode. This awkward approach was necessary because the model hadn't been trained specifically for conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chat Models: Designed for Dialogue\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI had a breakthrough realization: they could train models specifically for conversational interaction. By training on data structured as back-and-forth exchanges—one message, one response, another message, another response—they created what became known as chat models or instruct models.\n",
    "\n",
    "This training introduced the concept of different message types. A system prompt sets the overall context and instructions for the conversation. User prompts contain the actual questions or requests from the person interacting with the model. The assistant's responses complete the exchange. This structure became the foundation for ChatGPT.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training technique that enabled this transformation was called reinforcement learning from human feedback, often abbreviated as RLHF. This approach took GPT from a base model to ChatGPT, fundamentally changing how people could interact with language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning Models: Thinking Before Responding\n",
    "\n",
    "As people worked with chat models, they discovered interesting patterns. One particularly effective technique became known as chain-of-thought prompting. Simply adding \"Please think step by step\" to the end of your prompt often produced significantly better results. The model would work through the problem methodically, and the quality of its final answer improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "This observation sparked another innovation: what if models could be trained specifically to think through problems before answering? Reasoning models emerged from this insight. These models have been trained with numerous examples showing step-by-step thinking followed by conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you interact with a reasoning model, it first outputs its thinking process, then provides its answer. You saw this in action during the initial experiments with OpenAI's models—the gray text showing internal reasoning before the actual response. This explicit thinking step often leads to more accurate and well-considered answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid Models: Adaptive Intelligence\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest generation of models represents another evolution: hybrid models that can adjust how much thinking they do based on the question's complexity. For simple queries like \"Hi there,\" these models respond immediately without extensive reasoning. For complex puzzles or challenging problems, they engage in deeper analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ability to scale reasoning effort dynamically makes these models more efficient. They don't waste computational resources overthinking simple questions, but they can dedicate substantial thought to difficult problems. Both Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 exemplify this hybrid approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of reasoning a model performs is sometimes called its \"reasoning budget\" or \"reasoning effort.\" Techniques exist to force models to think longer, known as \"budget forcing.\" Some of these techniques are surprisingly simple—even hacky.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fascinating discovery documented in the S1 paper from January 2025 revealed that inserting the word \"wait\" into a model's thinking trace causes it to reconsider its reasoning. The model continues from \"wait\" as if reflecting: \"Wait, let me reconsider. Am I sure about this?\" This simple intervention leads to deeper analysis and often better outcomes. While it seems like there should be something more sophisticated at work, the research confirms that this straightforward technique genuinely improves results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use Each Model Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model variety has optimal use cases based on its strengths and limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reasoning models excel at problem-solving.** They consistently outperform chat models on puzzles and tasks requiring deep analysis. They score higher on intelligence-related benchmarks across nearly every category. When accuracy matters more than speed, reasoning models are the clear choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chat models prioritize speed and cost-efficiency.** Because they don't generate extensive reasoning traces, they respond faster and consume fewer computational resources. For interactive applications where responsiveness matters, chat models provide a better user experience. They're also demonstrably better at actual conversation, unsurprisingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chat models may be superior for creative content generation.** This point comes with a caveat—it's based more on anecdotal observation than rigorous metrics. Many practitioners find that reasoning models can overthink creative tasks, producing content that feels analytical and cold. Chat models often generate more fluid, natural-feeling text for tasks like writing emails or articles. This isn't definitively proven, so you should experiment yourself and form your own conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Base models have one specific advantage:** when you need to train a model for a completely different task or give it a new skill (something we'll explore later), starting with a base model provides more flexibility. You're not constrained by the chat or reasoning framework—you can teach the model whatever structure best suits your needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Major Frontier Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Frontier models represent the most powerful, cutting-edge language models currently available. Sometimes they're also called foundation models, though these terms lack strict definitions and are often used interchangeably.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI's GPT Series\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI offers the GPT range, with GPT-5 currently representing their flagship hybrid model combining chat and reasoning capabilities. They also maintain the O series of pure reasoning models, though GPT-5 effectively supersedes both the O series and earlier GPT versions.\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-4o-1 remains a favorite for many users despite being superseded by GPT-5. As a pure chat model without the reasoning overhead, it's significantly faster than GPT-5 even when GPT-5 is configured for minimal reasoning. This speed advantage makes it ideal for interactive applications where responsiveness matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer interface, ChatGPT, provides the familiar chat experience most people know well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Anthropic's Claude\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude comes in three size variants: Haiku (small), Sonnet (medium), and Opus (large). Claude Sonnet 4.5 represents the latest version at the time of this writing, though new releases come frequently. Claude has developed a devoted following in the developer community, with many practitioners considering it their preferred model. The reasons for Claude's popularity vary, but the community consensus is clear: Claude is beloved.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google's Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "Google had a rocky start in the language model space. Their initial offering, Bard, was widely criticized and led many to predict Google had fallen too far behind to catch up with OpenAI and Anthropic. This prediction proved dramatically wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini, Google's current model family, stands among the most powerful models available. Gemini 2.5 Pro represents the current version, though Gemini 3 appears imminent. Google has also made smaller versions of Gemini available for free in many regions, particularly for students, making it an accessible option for learning and experimentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### X.AI's Grok\n",
    "\n",
    "Elon Musk's X.AI produces Grok, which has cultivated its own following for various reasons. Grok represents the fourth major player in the frontier model space. The chat interface is also called Grok, though it's spelled with a K—not to be confused with Groq (spelled with a Q), which is a different service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Seek\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Seek stands out as an anomaly among frontier labs because they've open-sourced all their models, including their largest. This Chinese company provides a chat product also called Deep Seek. OpenAI has recently joined them in the open-source space with GPT-4o-s, possibly motivated by Deep Seek's example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Strengths of Frontier Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Frontier models possess remarkable capabilities that have fundamentally changed how people work with information and solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information synthesis** represents one of their most impressive strengths. These models excel at taking complex, lengthy information and distilling it into clear, structured summaries. Ask them to weigh pros and cons, compare options, or analyze situations, and they produce remarkably thorough, well-researched answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content generation** has become a core use case. Whether drafting emails, creating presentations, or planning projects, frontier models produce high-quality starting points. Many people use them as brainstorming partners, fleshing out ideas and creating structured frameworks for new initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Coding assistance** has perhaps created the most dramatic impact. Stack Overflow, once the unquestioned go-to resource for developers, has seen dramatic declines in traffic. Developers now turn to ChatGPT or Claude for debugging help and coding questions. These models explain solutions clearly, fix problems quickly, and often resolve issues that would have taken hours of searching and trial-and-error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation happened remarkably fast—within just a couple of years, AI assistants overtook all traditional resources for programming help. Claude and ChatGPT routinely solve problems that would have left developers pulling their hair out, doing so with clarity and ease.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations and Pitfalls\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite their impressive capabilities, frontier models have significant limitations that users must understand and work around.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knowledge gaps** exist even in areas where models show strong expertise. While they achieve PhD-level understanding in some scientific fields, they lack depth in others. Their training data has a cutoff date beyond which they have limited knowledge. This manifests in frustrating ways—Gemini might suggest you're using an incorrect model name and tell you to switch to an outdated version. Claude or GPT might confidently recommend models that no longer exist or were superseded years ago.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many chat products now incorporate web search capabilities to address this limitation. These search features aren't part of the underlying model—they're additional functionality that AI engineers have built into products like ChatGPT to help overcome the knowledge cutoff problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hallucinations** represent a persistent and dangerous issue. Models generate plausible-sounding text because they're trained to predict likely next words. They excel at sounding confident. The remarkable thing isn't that they hallucinate—it's that they don't hallucinate more often.\n",
    "\n",
    "Models are fundamentally predicting what sounds plausible, not what's true. The fact that plausible predictions so often turn out to be accurate is somewhat mysterious and surprising. But this means when models are wrong, they're wrong with tremendous conviction.\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates particular danger for junior developers or newcomers to a field. Initially, people thought LLMs would be most useful for beginners, helping them level up. The reality proved different. LLMs work best with experienced practitioners who can evaluate their output, catch mistakes, and challenge problematic suggestions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experimenting with Chat Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore these models through direct interaction, observing how they handle different types of questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing General Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "Start with a straightforward question that plays to their strengths: \"How do I decide if a business problem is suitable for an LLM solution?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The response demonstrates what these models do best. The answer is coherent, well-structured with clear headings and sub-points, and provides balanced perspectives. It addresses multiple aspects: defining the problem clearly, evaluating data availability, considering operational fit, and providing a quick assessment framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of query—asking for structured analysis of a complex topic—represents an ideal use case for frontier models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-Awareness Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Try something more intriguing: \"Compared with other LLMs, what kinds of questions are you best at answering and what do you find most challenging? Which other LLMs have capabilities that complement yours?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT-5 provides a thoughtful response acknowledging its strengths (teaching, structured explanations, synthesis across domains) and limitations (highly fresh information, mathematical precision in long derivations, extremely long ambiguous reasoning chains).\n",
    "\n",
    "Most fascinating is its willingness to recognize competitors' strengths. It acknowledges that Claude excels at long-context reasoning and human-like conversation. It notes Gemini's strength in real-time multimodal reasoning. This demonstrates a remarkable degree of self-awareness—or at least the ability to access and synthesize information about the competitive landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Emotional and Abstract Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask something deeply human: \"What does it feel like to be jealous?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The response reveals impressive emotional intelligence. It describes jealousy as a cocktail of layered emotions: fear, insecurity, anger, longing. It breaks down the experience physically (chest tightness, heat, restlessness), emotionally (fear of loss, resentment, guilt), and mentally (obsessive thinking). The overall characterization—\"a storm of vulnerability and competitiveness\"—captures the essence remarkably well.\n",
    "\n",
    "This could theoretically be reconstructed from training data, as articles about emotions exist online. But try more challenging questions that definitely lie outside explicit training data, and you'll find these models still produce compelling, insightful answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Features Beyond Chat\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern AI products offer capabilities that extend far beyond simple conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Research\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Research allows you to assign complex research tasks and have the AI work autonomously, returning later with comprehensive results. When you activate this feature (available in premium ChatGPT tiers), it begins by asking clarifying questions about scope, focus, time period, and other parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you answer these questions, the system initiates an extensive research process that can run for minutes or even hours. It searches multiple sources, reads articles, synthesizes information, and compiles detailed reports with citations. This represents one of the first mainstream examples of agentic AI—systems that work autonomously toward goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watching the research progress creates an eerie sense of something working on your behalf. You see the source count climb, observe reading activities, and witness an entity apparently \"sweating\" to produce results. This feeling of autonomy—of something genuinely happening without your direct involvement—characterizes the agentic AI experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent mode takes autonomous operation even further. You can assign tasks like: \"Find me a restaurant in NYC with availability tonight at 9 PM that serves British food and has banoffee pie on the menu.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The system then opens browser windows, navigates websites, checks restaurant listings, verifies menus, confirms reservations—all while you watch. The mouse moves without your input, forms get filled, pages get navigated. It's simultaneously impressive and slightly unsettling.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the agent completes its task, it not only presents the results (a restaurant meeting all criteria with confirmed availability) but offers to complete the booking on your behalf. This demonstrates a true assistant working behind the scenes to accomplish tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Image Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal capabilities include generating images from text descriptions. Request an illustration of that nonsensical rainbow question, and the system produces images attempting to visualize the concept. While current versions might be somewhat literal compared to earlier models, the capability to generate relevant imagery from abstract descriptions remains impressive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like Claude Code combine multiple capabilities into powerful development assistants. You can instruct them to read notebooks, understand challenges, and write solutions as complete, runnable modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude Code will read the materials, understand the problem, generate a complete solution, save it as a file, and produce working code that solves the assigned challenge. This demonstrates how these tools can understand context across multiple documents, synthesize requirements, and produce functional implementations autonomously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Reality of Frontier Models\n",
    "\n",
    "All major frontier models possess extraordinary capabilities that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago. Their ability to synthesize information, generate content, and assist with coding has made them indispensable tools for millions of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude tends to be a community favorite for reasons that vary among users. GPT-5 currently holds the title of most powerful model by most benchmarks. As these models converge in capability, factors like price and speed become increasingly important differentiators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding how to trade off intelligence, cost, and speed for your specific requirements becomes crucial as you build applications. We'll explore these considerations in depth during later sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformation these models have brought happened with stunning speed. Stack Overflow's decline from unbeatable resource to rarely-mentioned afterthought occurred in just a couple of years. This gives you a sense of the magnitude and pace of change these technologies represent.\n"

# InsureAll – Contract Renewal and Termination

Insurance contracts may be renewed or terminated based on policy terms.

## Renewal
Policies may renew automatically or require customer confirmation, depending on the product type. Premium adjustments may apply at renewal.

## Termination
Contracts may be terminated due to:
- Policyholder request
- Non-payment of premiums
- Regulatory requirements
- Material misrepresentation

Termination conditions are explicitly defined within each contract.

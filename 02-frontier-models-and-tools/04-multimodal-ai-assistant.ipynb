    "The transcription function starts by taking the path to an audio file as its input. Because audio files are binary data rather than plain text, the file is opened in **read-binary (`\"rb\"`) mode**, which ensures the raw audio bytes are handled correctly. This audio data is then sent to OpenAI’s **Whisper** speech recognition model, which analyzes the sound and converts spoken words into text. Once the transcription is complete, the function returns the recognized text so it can be used as normal user input.\n",
    "\n",
    "To keep the application stable, the function is wrapped in error handling logic. If anything goes wrong—such as a missing file, microphone issue, or API error—it safely returns an empty string instead of crashing the entire program. Compared to the text-to-speech function, this process is simpler because it only sends data to OpenAI and waits for text in return, without needing to manage audio playback or file cleanup.\n",

    "\n",
    "After receiving the AI’s reply, the function not only displays it but also passes it to the text-to-speech system so the assistant can respond out loud.

The `chat_history` parameter stores the full conversation so far, allowing the assistant to respond with proper context instead of treating each message in isolation. The `voice_choice` parameter controls which synthesized voice the assistant will use when speaking its response. Finally, `audio_file` is optional and represents a recorded voice message from the user, which may need to be transcribed before processing.\n",
    "\n",

If an audio file is provided, the function transcribes it into text; otherwise, it falls back to the typed input.

If the resulting input is empty or contains only whitespace, the function exits immediately without calling the language model, preventing unnecessary API calls and keeping the chatbot responsive and efficient.\n"

This system message acts as the “personality anchor” for the AI and is always included at the start of the conversation sent to OpenAI.\n",

    "Next, the function loops through the existing chat history and converts each turn into the format expected by OpenAI. This step is necessary because different versions of Gradio may store conversation data differently—sometimes as dictionaries and sometimes as lists or tuples. The function handles both cases defensively, extracting the user and assistant messages and transforming them into dictionaries with explicit `\"role\"` and `\"content\"` keys. Finally, the user’s new message is appended to the end of the `messages` list, ensuring the model sees the full, correctly structured conversation context before generating its response.\n",

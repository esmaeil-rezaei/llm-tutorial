    "# Configuring API Access\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer not to spend any money, detailed instructions for using free alternatives are provided in the course materials. You'll find complete examples demonstrating how to work with free models throughout the labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding OpenAI's Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "Navigate to platform.openai.com in your web browser. This is distinct from the ChatGPT consumer product. The platform is where developers access the API for building applications. This distinction confuses many people initially, so let's clarify it now.\n",
    "\n",
    "ChatGPT is a consumer product with its own pricing structure, typically around $20 per month for premium features. The API is a completely separate service with pay-as-you-go pricing. Paying for one does not grant access to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating an API Key\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have credit on your account, navigate back to Settings. Under the organization heading, select \"API Keys.\" You may see existing keys if you've used the platform before, but for this setup, you'll create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay close attention to the following steps. API keys are sensitive credentials that connect your code to your OpenAI account and billing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Click \"Create new secret key.\" The key should be owned by you, not a service account. Give it a memorable name like \"llm-tutorial-key\" so you can identify it later. For the project setting, select \"default project.\" Avoid applying any restrictions at this stage—additional constraints can cause errors in the labs. Leave permissions set to \"all.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Click \"Create secret key\" and a dialog will appear displaying your new key. It begins with \"sk-proj-\" followed by a long string of characters and numbers. This key functions exactly like a password. Every character must be correct for it to work. If you change even a single digit or letter, authentication will fail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the key to your clipboard immediately. Do not paste it anywhere else yet—keep it pristine in your clipboard. You'll paste it into your development environment `.env` in just a moment. The key cannot be viewed again after you close this dialog, so if you lose it before saving it properly, you'll need to create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Storing Your API Key Securely\n",
    "\n",
    "Return to Cursor with your API key still in your clipboard. If you have terminal windows open at the bottom of the interface, you can close them by clicking the X button to create a clean workspace.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're about to create a file called `.env` that will store your API key and other secrets. This file must be created with extreme precision. Many people encounter problems at this step, almost always due to spelling mistakes or incorrect file placement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `.env` file must be created at the project root—the top level of the llm-turorial directory, not inside any subdirectory. Right-click in the empty space below the list of folders in the sidebar and select \"New File.\" Verify that the new file appears at the same level as the week folders, not nested inside any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Name the file exactly as follows: `.env`**\n",
    "\n",
    "It must start with a period (dot), followed by the letters \"env\" in lowercase. It cannot be called \".env.txt\" or \"env\" without the period. It cannot have your name or any other suffix. The filename must be exactly `.env` and nothing else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the file you just created. You'll now add your API key in a specific format. Type the following exactly:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This must be spelled exactly as shown: \"OPENAI\" (one word, all capitals), underscore, \"API\" (all capitals), underscore, \"KEY\" (all capitals). Do not write \"OPEN_API_KEY\" or \"OpenAI_API_KEY\" or any other variation. The exact spelling is `OPENAI_API_KEY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, immediately after the equals sign with no spaces, paste your API key from your clipboard. The line should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-[your long key string here]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There should be no spaces around the equals sign and nothing after the key. Check carefully that you haven't accidentally pasted extra characters or spaces at the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the file immediately. On macOS, press Command+S. On Windows, press Ctrl+S. You can also use File > Save from the menu. The white dot next to the filename in the tab will disappear when the file is saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the small stop sign icon that appears next to the `.env` file in the sidebar. Hovering over it reveals that AI features are disabled for this file. This is intentional and correct. The `.env` file contains secrets—your API key connects to your credit card. Cursor protects you by ensuring this sensitive data is never sent to AI services for code suggestions. The stop sign indicates this protection is active.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Verifying Your Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's confirm everything is configured correctly. The most common issues at this point are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The file is not named exactly `.env`\n",
    "- The file is not saved (white dot still visible in the tab)\n",
    "- The environment variable name is misspelled\n",
    "- There are extra spaces around the equals sign\n",
    "- The API key was modified or truncated when pasting\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these issues exist, the verification step will fail with an error message. Review each point carefully before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing Cursor Extensions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running any code, you need to install extensions that enable Python development in Cursor. When you open a Python file for the first time, Cursor may prompt you to install recommended extensions. If this happens, simply click \"Yes\" and the extensions will install automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "If no prompt appears, you'll install them manually. Go to the View menu and select \"Extensions.\" This opens the extensions panel on the left side of the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search for \"Python\" in the extensions search box. You'll see two Python extensions in the results. One is made by Anthropic (the company behind Cursor), and another is made by Microsoft. Either works perfectly well. Most users install the Microsoft version. Click the extension and click \"Install.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, search for \"Jupyter\" and install the Jupyter extension, also from Microsoft. Jupyter enables the interactive notebook interface you'll use for all the labs. Once both extensions are installed, return to the View menu and select \"Explorer\" to restore the file browser sidebar.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Opening Your First Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In the sidebar, create a notebook like \"first-llm.ipynb.\" The \".ipynb\" extension stands for \"IPython Notebook,\" which is the format for interactive Python documents. The notebook should open in the main editor area.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top right of the notebook, you'll see a button labeled \"Select Kernel.\" The kernel is the Python environment that executes your code. Click this button and a dropdown menu will appear with options for \"Python Environments\" or \"Existing Jupyter Server.\" Select \"Python Environments.\"\n"
